Almost everybody earns money in this world, but very few of them actually spend it in a wise way. There is no doubt that managing finances will help anybody to have a
secure and safe financial future. I have attempted to solve this problem by creating a Real-Time Finance Management System (RFMS) wherein users can easily manage their finances. RFMS will also help users to learn more about stocks. They can create a sample portfolio of stocks and monitor them closely to see which direction their picked stocks
are headed. Graphs have been provided in the system for them to easily visualize and see the numbers in a clear perspective. Apart from stocks RFMS helps the users to manage their finances using the different finance management tools and calculators provided.
